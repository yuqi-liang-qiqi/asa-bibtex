This package provides a biblatex style for ASA (American Sociological Association)
compliant documents in LaTeX. The citation and bibliography styles (asa.cbx and asa.bbx)
are generated from the provided .dtx and .ins source files. After generation, these files
can be used with biblatex as a cohesive system for citations and reference formatting.

The ASA format implementation follows the guidelines from the American
Sociological Review and American Sociological Association Style Guide,
specifically for author-date citations and reference list formatting.

You will need to be using biblatex >= 3.14 and biber >= 2.14. The biber
backend for biblatex is required. This style will not work correctly if
using bibtex as the backend for biblatex. You should also have etoolbox
>= 2.5 for proper functionality.

The package provides three ways to use the ASA style:

1. Load the convenience package: \usepackage{biblatex-asa}
2. Load biblatex directly: \usepackage[style=asa]{biblatex}
3. Separate styles: \usepackage[citestyle=asa,bibstyle=asa]{biblatex}

The first option (biblatex-asa.sty) is recommended for most users as it
provides appropriate defaults and handles common configuration automatically.
